An bot to solve HCaptcha Text captcha using AI (non model).                                  
This can be used wihtout proxies, but residential proxies are preferred (higher success rates)      
                              
In main.py, replace the following:                                                                                                                                                                                                             
  &ensp; **site_url**: The captcha site_url payload                                                                              
  &ensp; **site_key**: The captcha site_key payload    

**NOTE**:                            
    &ensp; The solved tokens are flagged because of invalid motion data. I'm sure if someone uses this as as a base they can improve it/unflag it.
